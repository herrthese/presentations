# How To Deploy Ruby Apps Using Sinatra, Unicorn And Nginx on CentOS 6.5

---

# Agenda

* tbd

---

# Updating And Preparing The Operating System

Run the following command to update the default tools of your CentOS VPS:

`yum -y update`

Install the bundle containing development tools by executing the following command:

`yum groupinstall -y 'development tools'`

Some of the packages we need (e.g. nginx etc.) are not found within the official CentOS repository.
We will add the EPEL software repository for YUM package manager to use.

`sudo su -c 'rpm -Uvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm'`

`yum -y update`

---

# Setting Up Ruby Environment

Run the following two commands to install RVM and create a system environment for Ruby:

`
gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys D39DC0E3
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
source /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh
`

Finally, to finish installing Ruby on our system, let's get RVM to download and install Ruby version 2.1.0:

`
rvm reload
rvm install 2.1.0
`


---

# Installing Nginx

Run the following to download and install Nginx using yum from EPEL:

`yum install -y nginx`


---

# Installing Unicorn

Run the following to download and install Unicorn using gem:

`gem install unicorn`


---

# Installing Sinatra

Run the following to download and install Sinatra using gem:

`gem install sinatra`


---

# Creating A Sample Ruby Application using Sinatra


    require 'sinatra'

    class MyApp
        get '/' do
            "Hi! I'm a little sparkling Unicorn."
        end
    end

 Copy our Example in the application directory:

 `/var/www/my_app`

---

# Creating A Application Config-File

Create a `config.ru` with the following content:

    load "my_app.rb"

    run MyApp

 Copy our Example in the application directory:

 `/var/www/my_app`

---

# Configuring the Unicorn

Open up a blank `unicorn.rb` document, which will be saved inside `config/` directory with the following content:


    # Set the working application directory
    # working_directory "/path/to/your/app"
    working_directory "/var/www/my_app"

    # Unicorn PID file location
    # pid "/path/to/pids/unicorn.pid"
    pid "/var/www/my_app/pids/unicorn.pid"

    # Path to logs
    # stderr_path "/path/to/log/unicorn.log"
    # stdout_path "/path/to/log/unicorn.log"
    stderr_path "/var/www/my_app/log/unicorn.log"
    stdout_path "/var/www/my_app/log/unicorn.log"

    # Unicorn socket
    listen "/tmp/unicorn.[app name].sock"
    listen "/tmp/unicorn.myapp.sock"

    # Number of processes
    # worker_processes 4
    worker_processes 2

    # Time-out
    timeout 30


---

# Configuring the Nginx 1/2

Next, we need to tell Nginx how to talk to Unicorn. For this purpose, it is sufficient at this level to edit the default configuration file: `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` and leave `nginx.conf` as provided.

Replace the files contents with the ones from below, again amending the necessary bits to suit your needs:

    upstream app {
        # Path to Unicorn SOCK file, as defined previously
        server unix:/tmp/unicorn.myapp.sock fail_timeout=0;
    }

---

# Configuring the Nginx 2/2

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;

        # Application root, as defined previously
        root /root/my_app/public;

        try_files $uri/index.html $uri @app;

        location @app {
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
            proxy_redirect off;
            proxy_pass http://app;
        }

        error_page 500 502 503 504 /500.html;
        client_max_body_size 4G;
        keepalive_timeout 10;
    }

---

# Additional Setup

Create the following Folders:

    mkdir /var/www/my_app/pids
    mkdir /var/www/my_app/log

---

# Managing The Servers

Let's start the Unicorn and run it as a daemon using the configuration file:

    # Make sure that you are inside the application directory
    # /var/www/my_app
    unicorn -c config/unicorn.rb -D

Next, we are ready to reload and restart Nginx:

    service nginx restart

---

# We did it.
