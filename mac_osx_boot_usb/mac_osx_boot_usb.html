# Download Mac OS X (e.g. Yosemite)

- Download the OS X installer from the Mac App Store. Quit the installer if it opens automatically after downloading. The installer will be in your Applications folder.
- Mount your USB flash drive or other volume. You could also use a secondary internal partition.
- Open the Terminal app, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder.
- Use the `createinstallmedia` command in Terminal to create the bootable installer.

# Example for Yosemite

This is the basic syntax of the command. Replace `volumepath` with the path to your USB flash drive or other volume, and replace `installerpath` with the path to the Install OS X app.

The following examples assume that the OS X installer is in your Applications folder and the name of your USB flash drive or other volume is `Untitled`:

    sudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/
    createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/
    Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app

---

name: output

# Output

    john@doe:~ $ sudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/
    createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/
    Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app

    Ready to start.
    To continue we need to erase the disk at /Volumes/Untitled.
    If you wish to continue type (Y) then press return: Y
    Erasing Disk: 0%... 10%... 20%... 30%...100%...
    Copying installer files to disk...
    Copy complete.
    Making disk bootable...
    Copying boot files...
    Copy complete.
    Done.

*Attention: the Volume will be erased!*
